# AccuWeather Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the application from OpenWeather to AccuWeather for all weather data services.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New AccuWeather Service
- **File**: `lib/accuweather-service.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Current weather conditions
  - 5-day weather forecast
  - Location key resolution
  - Mock data fallback
  - Hurricane risk assessment

### 2. Updated Weather API Endpoints

#### Current Weather API (`pages/api/weather/current.ts`)
- **Before**: Used OpenWeather API (`api.openweathermap.org`)
- **After**: Uses AccuWeather API (`dataservice.accuweather.com`)
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced OpenWeather API calls with AccuWeather service
  - Maintained National Weather Service alerts integration
  - Preserved mock data fallback

#### Forecast API (`pages/api/weather/forecast.ts`)
- **Before**: Used OpenWeather 5-day forecast API
- **After**: Uses AccuWeather daily forecast API
- **Changes**:
  - Simplified data processing (AccuWeather provides daily data directly)
  - Maintained hurricane risk assessment
  - Preserved mock data fallback

### 3. Updated Environment Configuration
- **File**: `setup-env.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` reference
  - Updated documentation to reflect AccuWeather-only approach
  - Added note about OpenWeather removal

## API Key Requirements

### Required
- **AccuWeather API Key**: `ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY`
  - Get from: https://developer.accuweather.com/
  - Used for: Current weather, forecasts, and hurricane data

### Optional (Free Services)
- **National Weather Service**: Weather alerts (no API key required)
- **NOAA**: Hurricane tracking data (no API key required)

## Data Sources Priority

1. **AccuWeather** (requires API key)
   - Current weather conditions
   - 5-day forecasts
   - Hurricane data
   - Location services

2. **National Weather Service** (free)
   - Weather alerts
   - Severe weather warnings

3. **NOAA** (free)
   - Hurricane tracking
   - Storm data

4. **Mock Data** (fallback)
   - Used when APIs fail or keys are missing

## Benefits of AccuWeather Migration

### Advantages
- **Unified API**: Single API key for weather and hurricane data
- **Better Data Quality**: AccuWeather provides more detailed weather information
- **Consistent Format**: Standardized data structure across all weather services
- **Reliability**: AccuWeather has high uptime and data accuracy
- **Location Services**: Built-in location key resolution

### Cost Considerations
- AccuWeather offers free tier with limited requests
- More cost-effective than maintaining multiple weather APIs
- Better value for comprehensive weather data

## Testing Results

✅ **Current Weather API**: Working correctly, returns mock data when API key not configured
✅ **Forecast API**: Working correctly, returns 5-day forecast data
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to mock data when APIs fail
✅ **Data Structure**: Maintains compatibility with existing frontend components

## Next Steps

1. **Get AccuWeather API Key**:
   - Visit https://developer.accuweather.com/
   - Sign up for free account
   - Generate API key
   - Add to `.env.local`: `ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here`

2. **Test with Real Data**:
   - Restart development server after adding API key
   - Verify weather data is now real instead of mock

3. **Monitor Usage**:
   - AccuWeather free tier has request limits
   - Monitor usage in AccuWeather developer dashboard

## Migration Complete ✅

The application now uses AccuWeather exclusively for weather data, providing:
- Unified weather and hurricane data source
- Better data quality and reliability
- Simplified API key management
- Consistent data structure
- Robust fallback mechanisms
