- `lng`: Longitude coordinate

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  hasWeatherCondition: boolean
  condition?: EnhancedWeatherCondition
  recommendation?: WeatherRecommendation
  isHurricaneRiskZone: boolean
  location: {
    name: string
    lat: number
    lng: number
  }

}
```

## Integration

### Adding to Pages
```tsx
import { EnhancedWeatherNotification } from "@/components/enhanced-weather-notification"

    lat={userLocation.lat} 
    lng={userLocation.lng}
    onDismiss={(alertId) => {
      console.log('Weather alert dismissed:', alertId)
    }}
  />
)}
```

### Using the Service
```typescript
import { EnhancedWeatherService } from "@/lib/enhanced-weather-service"

const service = EnhancedWeatherService.getInstance()
const analysis = await service.getWeatherAnalysis(lat, lng)
const recommendation = service.getWeatherRecommendation(analysis)
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
